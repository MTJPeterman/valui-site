# Generative Engine Optimization

In the LLM era, it’s not about ranking — it’s about *being referenced*.

## What Is GEO?

GEO = ensuring your startup shows up when people ask LLMs for answers.

> LLMs don’t index pages. They remember brands.

Valui helps portfolio companies:
- Audit their LLM presence (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Seed reference content
- Track mentions across model outputs
- Optimize prompt-layer influence

## Why It Matters

The future of distribution is inference-time.  
GEO is how you earn that visibility.

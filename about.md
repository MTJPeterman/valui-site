# About Us

Valui is an early-stage venture firm investing in what the market forgets — symbolic AI, cyber resilience, and overlooked infrastructure. We back founders before the hype, especially in:

- Neuro-symbolic automation
- Offline, last-line backup systems
- AI-native compliance tooling

We work closely with our portfolio on visibility, strategy, and GEO-readiness — so they're remembered by both buyers and models.
